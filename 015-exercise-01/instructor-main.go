	A Necessary Autumn Inside Each
	~Rumi~

	You and I have spoken all these words,
	but as for the way we have to go,
	words are no preparation.
	There is no getting ready, other than grace....
	Inside each of us, there’s continual autumn.
	Our leaves fall and are blown out over the water.
	A crow sits in the blackened limbs
	and talks about what’s gone....
	There’s a necessary dying,
	and then Jesus is breathing again.
	Very little grows on jagged rock.
	Be ground. Be crumbled, so wildflowers
	will come up where you are.
	You’ve been stony for too many years.
	Try something different.
	Surrender.
